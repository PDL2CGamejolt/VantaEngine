Value 1: x, y, duration, ease*, additive**
Value 2(optional): delayUntilBack***, stick****

Tweens the camera to a certain position
After the tween is over, it'll focus on who it would normally (bf if mustHitSection, dad if not,
gf if gfSection)
(sorry that it clips out of the box just open the txt file lmao)
<<PLEASE NOTE THAT camFollow AND, BY EXTENSION, cameraX//cameraY, WILL
*NOT* UPDATE WHILE THE CAMERA IS TWEENING.>>


*MUST BE PROPERLY CAPITALISED!!!!1 (aka "cubeInOut" instead of "cubeinout")
**true/false. if false it moves the camera to the specified positions (like Camera Follow Pos)
if true, it acts as an offset to the current camera pos (adds or subtracts xy from it instead of hardcoded
coordinates, if that makes sense). Defaults to false.
***how long the camera will wait before going back to normal. defaults to 0 if no input is given
****true/false. whether the camera sticks after the tween is done or not. defaults to false.
how to reset the camera if stick is true: set isCameraOnForcedPos to false (or have a Camera Follow Pos
event with blank values)
